Build an interface with a stock price data feed and visually display data to assist our traders as a Software Engineer at JPMorgan Chase

Establish a connection to a stock price data feed and configure your system to analyze financial data using Python 3, Git, and basic programming skills.

Leverage JPMorgan Chase frameworks and tools to integrate the Perspective open source code, laying the groundwork for data visualization in web applications with React.js, TypeScript, and related technologies.

Present data in a visually compelling manner on the traders' dashboard by employing Perspective to craft interactive charts, requiring expertise in technical communications, financial analysis, and web application development.

Explore a bonus task by actively participating in open-source contributions, potentially enhancing Perspective or addressing backlog items in other open-source projects, thereby contributing to the broader open-source community.
